Short description:
<br>
The main idea of the game is to try to sink opponent's ships. The player can only see a matrix that represents a sea and can't see the opponents ships.
The idea is to guess where the opponent's ship could be located and try and hit that matrix cell. The end come is a hit or miss. The winner is the first
one to sink opponent's every ship.
