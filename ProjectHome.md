A team project for Sungkyunkwan University's Advanced Software Engineering course.

Note: this project is very likely to be on infinite hiatus. The <b>GUI</b> part is more or less done but the logical and server/client side code is on different project and is not integrated and never might. However you you plan on implementing a similar game the GUI sources might become helpful. In case you are interested in seeing the sources for logic and <b>client/server side</b> the project is hosted here: http://code.google.com/p/jbattleships/.

<p><b>The game is not playable</b></p>
