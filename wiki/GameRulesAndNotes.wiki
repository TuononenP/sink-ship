#summary Game rules and notes as discussed on meeting 09/21/2010.

==Implementation==
  * server-client architecture (server stand-alone application)
  * only 1-line ships for easier implementation
  * first do text-based interface, then graphical (keep in mind when designing!)
  * cross-platform (please don't use any windows super-uber-magic hacks, especially when programming GUI)

==Gameplay==
  * basic sink a ship rules and in addition
  * teams (public/private?) (2/more people per team)
  * shooting at all boards at once
  * friendly fire? 

Discussion in comments please.
